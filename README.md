This Python program demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis using the Tips dataset from the Seaborn library.

It performs the following steps:

Loads the first 10 rows of the tips dataset.

Uses total_bill as the independent variable (feature) and tip as the dependent variable (target).

Fits a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression.

Prints the slope (coefficient) and intercept of the fitted line.

Predicts the expected tip amount for a bill of $30 and $23.

Plots a scatter plot of the actual data points and overlays the regression line to visualize the model fit.

This example serves as a basic illustration of how linear regression can be applied to real-world data in Python.
